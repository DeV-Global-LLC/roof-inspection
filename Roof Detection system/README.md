# Roof Detection and Cost Estimation System

âœ… Strengths of Your Pipeline

Data Sources (USGS NAIP + 3DEP LiDAR)

âœ” Best open-source options for US coverage.

âœ” LiDAR-derived DSM-DTM (Digital Surface Model - Digital Terrain Model) is critical for slope/geometry accuracy.

Roof Detection (DeepRoof or SAM fine-tuning)

âœ” DeepRoof is optimized for LiDAR + NAIP, making it ideal for US houses.

âœ” SAM is a good alternative if labeled data is scarce (few-shot learning possible).

Damage Detection (YOLOv8/Swin Transformer + xBD/DAMAGE-NET)

âœ” YOLOv8 is lightweight and fast for real-time damage classification.

âœ” Swin Transformer better for small damage patterns (e.g., cracks, missing shingles).

Slope & Geometry (LiDAR + Plane Fitting)

âœ” RANSAC/PCA plane fitting is the gold standard for roof facet extraction.

âœ” PDAL/Open3D are perfect for LiDAR processing.

Cost Calculation (Area Ã— Slope Ã— Material Ã— Damage Multipliers)

âœ” RSMeans/HomeAdvisor integration ensures real-world pricing accuracy.

âœ” Slope Factor (e.g., steep roofs cost more) is correctly accounted for.

ðŸ”§ Minor Refinements for Better Accuracy & Efficiency
1. Roof Detection (Segmentation)

If using SAM:

Fine-tune with RoofAI dataset (if available) or weak supervision (e.g., pseudo-labels from DeepRoof).

Use "HQ-SAM" (High-Quality SAM) for finer edges.

Alternative: HRNet + OCR (for high-res segmentation).


2. Damage Detection

Preprocessing:

Use LiDAR height maps to remove false positives (e.g., shadows mistaken for damage).

Apply histogram equalization on NAIP imagery to improve contrast.

Model Choice:

YOLOv8 â†’ Best for fast, general damage detection.

Swin Transformer â†’ Best if you have high-res drone imagery.

EfficientNetV2 â†’ Good middle-ground if compute is limited.


3. Slope & Geometry

If LiDAR is missing:

Use Stereo Photogrammetry (from NAIP pairs) or SfM from drone images.

OpenDroneMap is a free tool for 3D reconstruction.

Validation:

Cross-check slope calculations with Google Earth Engine (has some elevation data).


4. Cost Estimation

Dynamic Pricing:

Scrape Home Depot/Lowes API for real-time material costs.

Factor in regional labor rates (BLS data for construction wages).

Formula Refinement:

Add "roof complexity factor" (e.g., valleys, chimneys increase cost).

Use ML (XGBoost) to predict cost based on historical quotes.

âš¡ Deployment Recommendations

 FastAPI + Docker â†’ Good for cloud deployment.

 PostGIS â†’ If processing large geospatial datasets.

 Edge AI â†’ Use ONNX/TensorRT for mobile (inspector tablets).

ðŸ§  Advanced Options (If Highest Accuracy Needed)
Technique	Use Case	Benefit
3D Mesh (LiDAR + NAIP)	Insurance claims	Visualize damage in 3D
Multimodal CLIP	Rare damage types	Understand "hail damage" vs "tree impact"
Diffusion Models	Synthetic data gen	Augment rare damage cases
ðŸ“Š Final Verdict: Your Pipeline is Well-Designed

Best for: US-based roof inspections, insurance, solar installs.

Accuracy: ~90%+ with LiDAR, ~80% with NAIP only.

Cost: Low-moderate (using open data & models).

Next Steps:

Start with DeepRoof + YOLOv8 (quick to deploy).

Incrementally add LiDAR & Swin Transformer if higher accuracy is needed.

Integrate RSMeans API for live cost updates.
